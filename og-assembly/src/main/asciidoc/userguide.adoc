== Configuration
OG is configured via a json formatted test configuration file. This file
controls which object storage API, request mix, file size mix and concurrency
to use, and more. To jump straight to complete examples, see <<Examples>>.
Otherwise, the following sections describe OG configuration in detail.

[[cref1]]
*_Note that the weights used for selection of choices are strictly weights. They are not
       percentages._*

=== Storage
OG supports the following Storage APIs:

|===
|Storage API

|S3

|OpenStack Swift

|Cleversafe SOH

|WebDAV
|===

Write, Read, Metadata, and Delete operations are supported for each of the supported
Storage APIs. In addition, Overwrite is supported for S3 and OpenStack Swift.
Storage API is configured via the _api_ key:

.S3 API Example
[source, json]
----
"api": "s3"
----

=== Authentication
OG supports the following authentication configurations:

|===
|Authentication

|Anonymous

|Basic Auth

|AWS Auth V2

|AWS Auth V4

|Keystone

|IBM Cloud IAM
|===

Authentication is configured via an _authentication_ block of the test
configuration:

[source, json]
----
"authentication": {}
----

Authentication credentials can be provided directly in the OG json
config file for a single user. The credentials can also be provided
in a file for multiple users. Please refer to <<credential_file_format>>


==== Anonymous
Anonymous authentication is the default authentication configuration. It
is configured by omitting the _authentication_ block from the test
configuration. It can also be explicitly configured.

.None Auth Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "none"
}
----

==== Basic Auth
Basic authentication uses base64 encoding to encode username and password
credentials into an authorization request header that is sent to the target
server.

When using basic auth for openstack swift implementation on a dsnet stass based release, storage account field is needed.
The given account is used in openstack swift API url.

.Basic Auth with Single User Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "basic",
  "username": "my_user",
  "password": "my_password"
}
----

.Basic Auth with Single User with OpenStack swift API
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "basic",
  "username": "my_user",
  "password": "my_password",
  "account": "swiftaccountX"
}
----
.Basic Auth with Multiple Users Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "basic",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json"
}
----

==== AWS Auth V2
AWS Auth V2 authentication is an S3 authentication scheme which uses an access
key and secret key for credentials. These keys are configured in OG via
_username_ and _password_ keys, respectively.

.AWS Auth V2 Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv2",
  "username": "AKIAIOSFODNN74SFNMK",
  "password": "nJalrUUFklNEMI/K7MDENG/gPwRfiCYXY73DER"
}
----

.AWS Auth V2 with Multiple Users Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv2",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json"
}
----

NOTE: The current AWS Auth V2 implementation does not support virtual host
addressing. See <<Virtual Host>> for more details.

==== AWS Auth V4
AWS Auth V4 authentication is an S3 authentication scheme which uses an access
key and secret key for credentials. These keys are configured in OG via
_username_ and _password_ keys, respectively.

With AWS Auth V4, the body of the request is included in the signing process.
AWS Auth V4 requests can either sign the entire request body up front, which
requires reading the entire contents first, or sign the body in chunks as the
request is sent. Chunked signing is configured via the _aws_chunked_ key.

NOTE: For more information about AWS V4 signing, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html[Signing and Authenticating REST Requests]

.AWS Auth V4 With Signing The Entire Request Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "username": "AKIAIOSFODNN74SFNMK",
  "password": "nJalrUUFklNEMI/K7MDENG/gPwRfiCYXY73DER"
}
----

.AWS Auth V4  With Signing The Entire Request with Multiple Users Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json"
}
----

.AWS Auth V4 With Chunked Signing Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "username": "AKIAIOSFODNN74SFNMK",
  "password": "nJalrUUFklNEMI/K7MDENG/gPwRfiCYXY73DER",
  "aws_chunked": true
}
----

.AWS Auth V4 With Chunked Signing with Multiple Users Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json",
  "aws_chunked": true
}
----

Because the signing process for V4 requests is CPU intensive, OG additionally
provides an optional mechanism for caching a portion of the signature process,
which reduces the CPU load on the load tool, which in turn reduces the risk of
the load tool as a performance bottleneck when executing V4 performance tests.
To enable caching, OG must be configured to write objects with all zeroes for
data (See <<Data>>) so that the signatures are cacheable. Then, to enable the
cache, configure the cache size via _aws_cache_size_.

.AWS Auth V4 With Signature Caching
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "username": "AKIAIOSFODNN74SFNMK",
  "password": "nJalrUUFklNEMI/K7MDENG/gPwRfiCYXY73DER",
  "aws_cache_size": 10000
}
----

.AWS Auth V4 With Signature Caching with Multiple Users Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "awsv4",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json",
  "aws_cache_size": 10000
}
----

==== Keystone
Keystone authentication is an OpenStack Swift authentication scheme which
typically relies on an external Keystone server to generate an authentication
token for use by object storage requests. Keystone support in OG does not
include token lookup via an external Keystone server. Rather, OG requires a
keystone token be manually generated prior to test start.

When using keystone auth for openstack swift implementation on a dsnet stass based release, storage account field is needed.
The given account is used in openstack swift API url.

.Keystone Example
[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "keystone",
  "keystone_token": "7fe2cd9ee6384a1894a43878d3e52daf"
}
----

  "account": "swiftaccountX"
}
----

[source, json]
----
"authentication": {
  "type": "keystone",
  "credential_source": "file",
  "credential_file": "/var/log/og/credentials.json"
}
----

==== IBM Cloud IAM
IBM Cloud authentication relies on external centrally-managed integrated services
to provide account management, authentication, and policy decision making.
Access to storage resources is provided based on requestor's access token
that is generated by token service using IBM BlueMix account ID and API key.
Cloud IAM support in OG does not include ID and key management and expects
provisioned access tokens that will remain valid during a test. 

.IBM Cloud IAM Example

=== Host
Host is the target endpoint that the OG load tool communicates with to execute
object storage requests. A host can be either a host name or an IPv4 IP
address. OG supports single and multiple host configurations. For multiple
hosts, OG supports selection of a host for a given request via round robin,
random, or weighted random configurations. Host(s) are configured via the
_host_ key.

NOTE: When testing against a Cleversafe dsNet, the _host_ key refers to
Accesser hostnames or IP addresses.

.Single Host Example
[source, json]
----
"host": "s3.amazonaws.com"
----

.Multiple Host Round Robin Example
[source, json]

      "choice": "s3.amazonaws.com",
      "weight": 2.0
    }
  ]
}
----
_<<cref1,See note about weights>>_.

=== Port
OG supports configuring the port that object storage requests are executed
against. Port configuration applies to all configured hosts. Port is
configured via the _port_ key.

.Port Example
[source, json]
----
"port": "8080"
----

=== Container
Container is the logical bucket that the OG load tool will write objects into.
OG supports single and multiple container configurations. For multiple
containers, OG supports selection of a container for a given request via round
robin or random configurations. With multiple containers, _prefix_,
_min_suffix_ and _max_suffix_ keys are used to produce a range of container
names. Container(s) are configured via the _container_ key. This key is available
at both the top level and operation level. The most common usage at the operation
level is for StaaS container creation.

NOTE: If writes are done using container suffixes, then all other operations
using these objects will need to use a prefix only or prefix+suffix with
the object configuration block.

NOTE: When testing against a Cleversafe dsNet, the _container_ key refers to
dsNet Vaults or StaaS containers.

.Single Container Example
[source, json]
----
"container": "my_container"
----

.Multiple Container Round Robin Example
[source, json]
----

}
----

=== Headers
Custom HTTP request headers can be added to every request that is executed.
Header values can be constant or dynamic. For dynamic header value
configuration, values can be selected via round robin, random or weighted
random. Headers are configured via the _headers_ key.

NOTE: Custom headers will be added to every request. To add custom headers
only for a specific operation type, see <<Operation Headers>>

=== Write, Overwrite, Read, Metadata, Delete, List, Container Create, Container List, Multipart Write Operations, Write Legalhold, Delete Legalhold, Read Legalhold

Write, Read, Metadata, Delete, and List operations are supported for all Object Storage APIs.
Write operation supports adding LegalHold and retention to the object.
Writecopy is only suppported for s3.
Overwrite is supported for S3 and OpenStack Swift
Write Legalhold operation will add a Legalhold to an existing object.
Delete Legalhold operation will remove Legalhold on an object.
Read Legalhold operation will list the legalholds on an object
Container Create and Container List are supported for S3 only and the current dsnet implementation
requires the uri_root be set to "/".
Multipart Write is also only supported for S3
Operation mix is configured via _write_, _overwrite_, _read_, _metadata_, _delete_, _list_,
_container_create_, _container_list_, _multipart_write_ keys respectively.

Each operation type is configured via a configuration block. E.g. for write:

[source, json]
----
"write": {}
----

The configuration block supports _weight_, _host_, _object_ and _header_ keys.

==== Operation Weight
The _weight_ configuration key determines the relative number of requests for
each operation type. _<<cref1,See note about weights>>_.

.Operation weights Example
The configuration below will produce two write operations for a single read operation.
[source, json]
----
"write": {"weight": 2.0},
"read": {"weight": 1.0},
"delete": {"weight": 0.0}
----

==== Operation Host
OG supports overriding the global host configuration for a particular operation
type. See <<Host>> for more details.

==== Operation Object
OG supports multiple object name configurations via the _object_ key:

[source, json]
----
"object": {}
----

Note that *object configuration property should be included under the Operation (write, read etc.) config*.
If the object block is defined at root level, it will not have any effect.

By default, OG will generate a unique, uuid-like object name for every write
request. Writecopy operation will select a random object name from objects which have already been written for source object.
By default, the destination object name will be a unique, uuid-like object name.
Overwrite, Read, Metadata, and Delete requests will select a random object name from
objects which have already been written. List will use a random object name as its starting
point and then provide the default number of entries for the associated API.
See <<Object Management>>.

To override this behavior, the _object_ configuration block can be configured
to include _selection_, _prefix_, _min_suffix_ and _max_suffix_ keys. Random
and round robin selection configuration is supported. The resulting object name
will be of the form:

[source, bash]
----
<prefix><suffix>
----

WARNING: Using custom object name configuration bypasses object management.
Object names written with a custom prefix and suffix will not be stored in the
object manager, for example.

CAUTION: The Cleversafe SOH Storage API does not support custom object names.
Instead, an auto-generated name is returned to the client after the object has
been written. Because of this, custom object name configuration should not be
configured in OG for use with the SOH API.

.Random Object Name Example
[source, json]
----
"object": {
  "selection": "random",
  "prefix": "my_object",
  "min_suffix": 0,
  "max_suffix": 100
}
----

.Round Robin Object Name Example
[source, json]
----
"object": {
  "selection": "roundrobin",
  "prefix": "my_object",
  "min_suffix": 0,
  "max_suffix": 100
}
----

==== Operation Headers
OG supports custom headers for a particular operation type. Headers configured
for an operation type override any custom headers which were configured
generally. See <<Headers>> for more details.

.Custom Headers For Write Requests Example
[source, json]
----
"write": {
  "headers": {
    "custom_key_01": "custom_value_01",
    "custom_key_02": "custom_value_02"
  }
}
----

==== Operation Query Parameters
OG supports custom query parameters for a particular operation. This is
currently supported only for the List operation.

.Custom Query For List Requests Example
[source, json]
----
"list": {
  "parameters": {
    "custom_key_01": "custom_value_01",
    "custom_key_02": "custom_value_02"
  }
}
----

==== Operation Container
OG supports the _container_ key at the operation level with some
caveats as noted in the Container section.

==== Operation Multipart Write
Multipart write supports an additional part size parameter so that the user
can define one or more part sizes as part of the object block to use in conjunction
with filesize. The default part size is 5MiB and part size is defined in bytes in the config
document.

.Example Multipart Write using Multiple Part Sizes
[source, json]
"multipart_write": {
    "upload": {
        "part_size": {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "choice": 5242880,
                    "weight": 1
                },
                {
                    "choice": 10242880,
                    "weight": 2
                }
            ],
            "selection": "random"
        },
        "parts_per_session": {
            "choices": [],
            "selection": "random"
        },
        "target_sessions": 1
    },
    "weight": 100
},

.Example Multipart Write using a Single Part Size
[source, json]
"multipart_write": {
        "weight": 1.0,
        "part_size": 5242880
}

Regarding the OG implementation of Multipart Write, there are some caveats. In the current
implementation, OG will send as many INITIATE requests as it can, up to the thread count, until
it receives an upload id response from one of the requests. At that point, it will begin
sending PART requests for in process multipart sequences in order of INITIATE request responses.
Once all parts are uploaded, a COMPLETE will be sent before any other PART or INITIATE requests are sent.

For example, in a 100 thread test, up to 100 INITIATE requests will be sent. Once one request
returns, it will begin sending parts for that request, up to 100 parts at a time. Once all those
parts are in process or finished, it will begin sending parts for the other requests.

==== Operation ServerSide Encryption with Client Provided Key
The uploaded object can be encrypted with server side encryption with client provided key. This can
be indicated by setting sse_c_source property to true. In case of PUT COPY operation, the target object
can be encrypted by setting sse_c_destination property to true.

OG uses predefined key for AES 256 encryption. This will be used as client encryption key unless
relevant headers are provided in the config. The relevant headers for this are:

* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
* x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
* x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key
* x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

Please refer to AWS S3 API reference for further details about this header fields.

An example write_copy operation is show below:
----
  "write_copy": {
    "weight": 1.0,
    "object": {

Refer to section <<operation_configuration>> in Appendix for further details about this configuration property.

=== Operation LegalHold
When Legalhold is set on the object, the object is protected and cannot be modified until
the legalhold is removed from the object.

If a legalhold prefix is specified, that will be used. Otherwise, the default prefix is
"LegalHold".  The percentage field indicates percent times the legal_hold operation is supplied.
The percentage value for write operation can be between 0 and 100. For write_legalhold and delete_legalhold operations
percentage must be 100.00.

----
    "legal_hold": {
      "legal_hold_prefix": "MyLegalHold",
      "percentage" : 50.00
    }
----

      "selection": "random",
      "min_suffix": -1,
      "max_suffix": -1
    }
  }
----




=== Operation Retention
Retention add a time expiry to an object. The object will be protected until the
retention time expires.

The expiry value of -1 is a special value. In this case, no retention is set. The object retention is set to the default
retention of the vault.

----
    "retention": {
      "selection": "random",
      "choices": [
        {
          "choice": {
            "expiry": 86400,
            "time_unit": "seconds"
          },
          "weight": 1.0
        }
      ]
    }
----

=== Filesize
OG supports one or more filesize distributions for describing desired body lengths of
generated objects. Filesize configuration block can be added to _write_, _overwrite_ and _multipart_write_ 
operations to override global configuration. If multiple filesize distributions are
configured, round robin, random and weighted random selection are supported.

Each file size distribution supports _distribution_, _average_, _average_unit_,
_spread_ and _spread_unit_ keys. *uniform* and *normal* distributions are
supported.

For *uniform* distribution, the shape of the distribution is _average_ +/-
_spread_. For *normal* distribution the shape of the distribution is centered
about _average_, with one standard deviation of _spread_.

Both _average_unit_ and _spread_unit_ support a large number of size units.
See <<Filesize Units>> for details. Units are case insensitive.

----

_<<cref1,See note about weights>>_.

=== Data
Data determines what type of source data is used for write requests. By
default, OG will generate a small, fixed buffer of random data for every write
request, which is returned repeatedly until the length of the object is
satisfied. Optionally, data can be configured to use all zeroes for object
content. Data is configured via the _data_ key; valid options are *random* and
*zeroes*.

.Zeroes Data Example
[source, json]
----
"data": "zeroes"
----

=== Concurrency
Concurrency configuration allows the OG tool to execute requests in parallel.
There are two types of supported concurrency in OG, *threads* and *ops*.
Concurrency is configured via the _concurrency_ key.

List operations are very resource intensive and excessive concurrency may result
in 503 errors.

[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {}
----

==== Threads Concurrency
Thread testing involves configuring a fixed number of concurrent TCP
connections, each of which will execute requests as quickly as possible. Thread
based testing is good for measuring system capacity.

Thread testing supports _count_, _rampup_ and _rampup_unit_ keys. Rampup
allows a thread based test to build up to a steady connection rate over a
configurable period of time.

.Single Thread Example
[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {
  "type": "threads",
  "count": 1
}
----

.Multiple Threads Example
[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {
  "type": "threads",
  "count": 10
}
----

.Multiple Threads With Rampup Example
[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {
  "type": "threads",
  "count": 10,
  "rampup": 60,
  "rampup_unit": "seconds"
}
----

See <<Time Units>> for supported time units.

==== Request Rate Concurrency
Request Rate concurrency (ops) testing involves configuring a desired request
rate at which to send requests. A variable number of TCP connections will be
used to satisfy the configured rate. Request rate testing is good for measuring
system latency.

Request Rate testing supports _count_, _unit_, _rampup_ and _rampup_unit_
keys. Rampup allows an ops based test to build up to a steady request rate
over a configurable period of time.

.Request Rate (100 op/s) Example
[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {
  "type": "ops",
  "count": 100,
  "unit": "seconds"
}
----

[source, json]
----
"concurrency": {
  "type": "ops",
  "count": 500,
  "unit": "minutes",
  "rampup": 60,
  "rampup_unit": "seconds"
}
----

See <<Time Units>> for supported time units.

=== Stopping Conditions
Stopping conditions determine when a running OG instance should stop. By
default, OG will run indefinitely until a user stops it via a ctrl-c or
equivalent signal. Stopping conditions are configured via the
_stopping_conditions_ key:

[source, json]
----
"stopping_conditions": {}
----

==== Operations
The operations stopping condition causes OG to stop when a threshold number
of operations has completed. Operations is configured via the _operations_
key.

NOTE: Since Multipart Write is a sequence of multiple operations, the operation count does
not map directly to the number of Multipart Write sequences, but the total number of
operations for all sequences. For example, a single Multipart Write of an object consisting
of an Initiate, Part, Part, and Complete would count as 4 operations towards the
stopping condition

.Stop after 100 Operations Example
[source, json]
----
"stopping_conditions": {
  "operations": 100
}
----

==== Runtime
The runtime stopping condition causes OG to stop when a threshold period of
time has elapsed. Runtime is configured via the _runtime_ and _runtime_unit_
keys.

.Stop after 3.5 Hours Example
[source, json]
----
"stopping_conditions": {
  "runtime": 3.5,
  "runtime_unit": "hours"
}
----

See <<Time Units>> for supported time units.

==== Status Codes
The status codes stopping condition causes OG to stop when a threshold number
of status codes of a given number have been received.

.Stop After One Hundred "200" Status Codes Received Example
[source, json]
----
"stopping_conditions": {
  "status_codes": {
    "200": 100
  }
}
----

.Stop After Any "404", "500", or "503" Status Codes Received Example
[source, json]
----
"stopping_conditions": {
  "status_codes": {
    "404": 1,
    "500": 1,
    "503": 1
  }
}
----

NOTE: OG uses a special reserved status code *599* to indicate a failed or
aborted request. This special status code can also be used as a status code
stopping condition.

=== Secure HTTP connections
Secure http connections can be used with HTTPS scheme with SSL/TLS for OG operations.
To do this the following configuration needs to be set in addition to other
properties.

- https scheme
- trust self signed certificate if needed in client configuration
- Optionally specify a list of cipher algorithms to use in client configuration


.sample configuration
[source, json]
----
{
  "scheme": "https",
  "client": {
    "cipher_suites": ["TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"],
    "trust_self_signed_certificates": true,
  }
}
----

=== Object Management
OG tracks the state of objects written to containers. The OG object manager
writes metadata about the objects into a set of binary files called "object
files". Object management is configured via the _object_manager_ key. The
location to store object files is configured via _object_file_location_ and
_object_file_name_ keys.

_object_file_location_ specifies which directory the object file(s) should be
written to. The default location is in the *object* sub-directory of the OG
distribution.

_object_file_name_ specifies a file prefix to use when writing object files.
Every object file that is written will contain a numeric component to the file
name. If _object_file_name_ was configured as *my_object* and three files were
written over the course of an OG test, the resulting object file names would be
*my_object0.object*, *my_object1.object*, and *my_object2.object*, respectively.

If _object_file_name_ is not specified, a default name of the following form is
used:

[source, bash]
----
<container prefix>-<api>
----

.Object Manager Example
[source, json]
----
"object_manager": {
  "object_file_location": "/var/log/og-objects",
  "object_file_name": "my_objects"
}
----


With release 1.4.0, the binary file format for object files is changed. The binary file
contains a version header VERSION:<major_version><minor_version>.  Two additional fields
are also tracked - number of legalholds on the object and the retention time of the
object.

WARNING: Object files are not thread safe. Multiple instances of the OG tool
should not share the same set of object files. Attempting to do so will result
in object file corruption and/or a loss of object file metadata.

=== Advanced Configuration
OG supports several additional advanced configuration options that enable its
use for more complex scenarios, edge case testing and defect reproduction.

CAUTION: It is recommended to avoid modifying any of the below configuration
options unless a particular advanced configuration is required for testing.

==== URI Root
OG supports configuring the root URI path at which the object storage API is
located. URI Root is configured via the _uri_root_ key and the default value
is to root the configured Storage API at _/<api>/_. For example, request URIs
for S3 requests using the default _uri_root_ would take the form:

[source, bash]
----
/s3/<container>/<object>
----

.URI Root Alternate Example
[source, json]
----
"uri_root": "/"
----

==== Virtual Host
Some Object Storage implementations support virtual host addressing, which is
a way to express containers as virtual sub-domains. OG supports this
configuration via the _virtual_host_ key. The default configuration is false,
which means that object storage request URIs are of the form:

[source, bash]
----
<host>://<uri_root>/<container>/<object>
----

With virtual host set to true, request URIs are of the form:

[source, json]
----
<container>.<host>://<object>
----

NOTE: When virtual host is enabled, the _uri_root_ configuration is ignored.

==== Shutdown Behavior
By default, when OG shuts down it aborts all in progress requests in order to
ensure that the tool terminates in a reasonable time. For some use cases, it is
valuable to configure the tool to allow in progress requests to complete prior
to termination. This option is configured via the _shutdown_immediate_ key.

.Graceful Shutdown Example
[source, json]
----
"shutdown_immediate": false
----

==== Client Behavior
OG supports a large number of TCP and HTTP tuning parameters which affect
client execution behavior. For a complete list, see <<Client Configuration>>.

==== Object Management Behavior
OG supports several configuration options for modifying object management
behavior. These keys are for development use only and should not be modified
for production testing. See <<Object Manager Configuration>>.


==== Environment Variables
OG exposes several environment variables which can be used to modify functional
and performance characteristics of the tool. They include:

|===
|Environment Variable|Description

|OG_MEMORY
|Maximum JVM heap size, in megabytes. Default is 2048 (2GB)

|OG_ULIMIT
|Maximum open file handles. Default is 4096. Useful to increase if testing
concurrency larger than 4000 threads (not recommended).

|OG_TEST_PATH
|Configure a custom test log path

|OG_GC_LOG
|Configure a custom gc log name. The gc log will be logged relative to
OG_TEST_PATH
|===

==== Object Management Script
OG also includes an _object-file_ shell script, which is used for reading and
writing object files. A description of the usage of this script is outside the
scope of this guide, and the script itself is rarely useful other than for
development purposes.

With release 1.4.0, the object-file is enhanced to support both pre-1.4.0 object files (1.0) and
1.4.0 object files (v2.0).


== Results
For each OG test that is run, a test results directory is created with the
starting timestamp of the test.

[source, bash]

== FAQ

===== Q: What does _com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException_ mean?

A: _MalformedJsonException_ means that the json configuration file that has
been passed to OG has a syntax error. Common json syntax errors include missing
or extra commas, curly braces and square braces.

When a malformed configuration file is passed to OG, An error message will be
printed to the console:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./og conf/sample/simple-s3.json
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object Generator (1.0.0-SNAPSHOT)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring...
Test Error. See og.log for details
com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Unterminated object at line 4 column 2 path $.api
----

In the above example, the error message indicates that there is likely a
missing comma on line 4 of the configuration file.

===== Q: I see several _SocketException_ and _CancellationException_ messages in og.log, should I be concerned?

A: These exceptions are typically either a result of a closed TCP connection
or OG shutdown. If the exceptions correlate with expected shutdown of the OG
tool then they are likely of no concern. If an exception is logged in the
middle of a test, it may be worth investigating. Closed sockets are usually due
to either a network problem, or an overloaded system under test.

===== Q: I am attempting to run a write/read/delete mix test but it keeps stopping immediately. Why?

A: When running a mixed operation test in OG, the choice of next operation is
determined randomly based on the configured weights of each operation. If no
previous test has been run to populate a container with objects, and a mixed
operation test is executed, there is a chance that a read or delete operation
request will not have any previously written object to draw from. This will
cause a perceived "early termination" of the tool.

To prevent early termination of OG, run a write operations only workload to
populate container(s) with a sufficient number of objects prior to running
mixed operation tests.

[[credential_file_format]]
=== Credential File Format
The Credential file is needed if the credential source is to set to file. Credential file contains the credential
information necessary for invoking object storage api and authentication.

The older format of the credential file contains a comma separated s3 access key, secret key pair.

With this release of OG, it expects an updated format of the credential file. The credential file contains the account
information (account name, list of containers), credential information like basic authentication username, password,
aws access key and secret key, keystone token, container list.

Each line in the new credential file is a json representation of the account information. The information depends on the API,
type of authentication used.

Based on the authentication type, relevant properties will be used - basic_auth_username, basic_auth_password for basic
authentication, keystone for keystone token based authentication, s3 credentials for awsv2 and awsv4, IAM token for
IAM authentication, etc.

OpenStack with swift on Stass dsnet implementation requires an account name and the container name in the API. Swift
API version 1 is used in OG. In case of vault mode, account name is not needed. API is called
with account "dummyaccount" for vault mode.
